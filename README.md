## ‚ùì Who am I ?

I'm a french Engineering student at Enseeiht in Toulouse, France. I love science and have been particularly interested by astronomy for around 6 years now. I am specialised in Signal Processing and AI. I love to learn about new topics and notably when they are space related. My syllabus includes image processing, keeping me close to my astrophoto hobby. As a student, I use this account mostly to keep track of my coding projects starting my second year out of three in engineering school. This Engineering diploma is equivalent to a Master in Engineering : it is done in 5 years, 2 in an intensive preparatory course and 3 in an engineering school.

To avoid plagiarism issues, I keep my repositories private until the assignement has been graded. 

## üíª Projects I am working on 

Throughout my years at ENSEEIHT, I've had the occasion to work on several projects, whether they are club related or not.
<br><br>
One of the biggest project I've had the occasion to work on is [Churros](https://git.inpt.fr/inp-net/churros) as a member of @inp-net.
With **only basic** HTML/CSS knowledge in september, I am now a full-stack developper on this project, having worked notably on the [shop section](https://git.inpt.fr/inp-net/churros/-/merge_requests/127) of the app !
