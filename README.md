## ❓ Who am I ?

I'm a french Engineering student at Enseeiht in Toulouse, France. I love science and have been particularly interested by astronomy for around 6 years now. I am specialised in Signal Processing and AI. I love to learn about new topics and notably when they are space related. My syllabus includes image processing, keeping me close to my astrophoto hobby. As a student, I use this account mostly to keep track of my coding projects starting my second year out of three in engineering school. This Engineering diploma is equivalent to a Master in Engineering : it is done in 5 years, 2 in an intensive preparatory course and 3 in an engineering school.

## 💻 Projects I am working on 

Throughout my years at ENSEEIHT, I've had the occasion to work on several projects, whether they are club related or not.
<br><br>
⚙️ Being Specialized in Deep Learning, one of my most important [project](https://github.com/Etienne-bdt/Deep-Decoding) is quite probably an implementation of Heckel and Hand's [Deep Decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03982) (arXiv:1810.03982). 
It has been one of the most complex and rewarding project as the implementation was done **before following the deep learning course**. This project is functionnal and has been __implemented in MATLAB__. Due to code plagiarism, this project is private until it has been graded. I will attempt a PyTorch implementation to acquire knowledge about the Python Libraries related to this field.
<br><br>
👁️ Other Projects I am proud of are : [Kmeans segmentation in C](https://github.com/Etienne-bdt/Projet-Image) using OpenCV and [SuperPixel Segmentation in MATLAB](https://github.com/Etienne-bdt/Modelisation)
Both projects aim at teaching us the basis of computer vision using segmentation.

## 🕐 Upcoming Projects

### 🎯Next Month 
  - The deep learning introduction course, using python, pytorch and Jupyter Notebooks.
  - Computationnal Statistics ...

### 🗾 This Summer

During the summer, I will have the opportunity to travel to Kyoto in Japan. During 3 months, I will do an internship @ [KUAS](https://www.kuas.ac.jp/en/). This will be an inestimate opportunity to strengthen skills I acquired and learn more about remote sensing and deep learning methods notably using TensorFlow.

### 🛤️ Next Year
  - GPS courses
  - Audio processing with voice recognition
  - Remote sensing course
  - (Un)Supervised Learning
  - Data Analysis course

## 🐈☕🥐 Skills
ENSEEIHT allowed me to develop those skills particularly

## 🤝 Associative work 

One of the biggest project I've had the occasion to work on is [Churros](https://git.inpt.fr/inp-net/churros) as a member of @inp-net.
With **only basic** HTML/CSS knowledge in september, I am now a full-stack developper on this project, having worked notably on the [shop section](https://git.inpt.fr/inp-net/churros/-/merge_requests/127) of the app !

Special skills I developped for this project :
